Implement a Photographer class that has an ArrayList of cameras
Create addCamera and removeCamera methods
Create a Camera interface that has one method - printDetails (prints the details of the camera e.g. shutter speed etc.)
Remember the implementation of the method should be in the implementing classes not the interface
Create a DigitalCamera class and an AnalogueCamera that implement the Camera interface
Give the Photographer the ablity to print out all the details of his camera collection

Extension:

Add a HashMap "journal" to the Photographer with a key for the day and a numberOfPhotos for the count
Remember:

To use a TDD approach - tests first
Commit to Git

Questions:
1. when do we require main?
